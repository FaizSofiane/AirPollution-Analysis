# AirPollution-Analysis

## The dataset :

The air pollution dataset provides geolocated information about four types of pollutants: Nitrogen Dioxide [NO2], Ozone [O3], Carbon Monoxide [CO], and Particulate Matter [PM2.5]. The dataset includes hourly measurements of each pollutant at different monitoring stations located in various cities around the world, covering a time period from January 2015 to December 2020.

Each record in the dataset contains the following information:

City: the name of the city where the monitoring station is located.

Country: the name of the country where the monitoring station is located.

NO2: the hourly concentration of Nitrogen Dioxide (in micrograms per cubic meter, µg/m³).

O3: the hourly concentration of Ozone (in µg/m³).

CO: the hourly concentration of Carbon Monoxide (in milligrams per cubic meter, mg/m³).

PM2.5: the hourly concentration of Particulate Matter with a diameter of 2.5 micrometers or less (in µg/m³).


The dataset is provided in a comma-separated values (CSV) file format, which can be easily imported into a wide range of data analysis tools and programming languages for further analysis and visualization.
