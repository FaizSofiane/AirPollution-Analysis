# AirPollution-Analysis

## The dataset :

The air pollution dataset provides geolocated information about four types of pollutants: Nitrogen Dioxide [NO2], Ozone [O3], Carbon Monoxide [CO], and Particulate Matter [PM2.5]. The dataset includes hourly measurements of each pollutant at different monitoring stations located in various cities around the world, covering a time period from January 2015 to December 2020.

Each record in the dataset contains the following information:

City: the name of the city where the monitoring station is located.

Country: the name of the country where the monitoring station is located.

NO2: the hourly concentration of Nitrogen Dioxide (in micrograms per cubic meter, µg/m³).

O3: the hourly concentration of Ozone (in µg/m³).

CO: the hourly concentration of Carbon Monoxide (in milligrams per cubic meter, mg/m³).

PM2.5: the hourly concentration of Particulate Matter with a diameter of 2.5 micrometers or less (in µg/m³).


The dataset is provided in a comma-separated values (CSV) file format, which can be easily imported into a wide range of data analysis tools and programming languages for further analysis and visualization.


## Goal:

The project involves the analysis and visualization of data on air quality in different cities around the world. The data was collected from the open data platform "OpenAQ".

Visualizations were created to better understand the data. Graphs such as histograms, box plots, heat maps, bar charts, line charts, etc. were created to illustrate the most important information contained in the data.

Advanced analyses were also performed, such as creating linear regression models to determine correlations between different variables, and creating interactive maps to visualize air quality at different locations around the globe.

The overall goal of this project was to provide a comprehensive understanding of air quality worldwide, using scientifically valid data and transforming it into actionable visualizations and analyses.
